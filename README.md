Data Warehouse database Design For Star_Schema

IN THIS PROJECT, WE DESIGNED A DATA WAREHOUSE FOR AN ECOMMERCE OLTP DATABASE USING THE SLOWLY CHANGING DIMENSION (SCD) TECHNIQUE. SSIS PACKAGES WERE CREATED TO DESIGN THE DIMENSIONS FOR THE STAR SCHEMA, AS WELL AS SSIS PACKAGES FOR THE FACT TABLE. ALSO. TO DEFINE CONNECTIONS TO ALL DIMENSION AND FACT LOADS, WE CREATED A MASTER PACKAGE. FINALLY, WE DEPLOYED THE PROJECT FROM THE ISPAC FILE AFTER PRAAMETERIZING THE CONNECTIONS AND DEFINING SSIS LOGGING.

 WORK FLOW:
	
                 /**** PHASE 1 ****/
STEP 1: CREATE DATABASE IN MY LOCAL SQL SERVER. 

STEP 2: CREATE SCHEMAS IN  ABOVE DATABASE

STEP 3: CREATE TABLES USING ABOVE SCHEMAS

STEP 4: DEFINE RELATIONS USING ABOVE TABLES AND SCHEMAS

STEP 5: ADD SAMPLE DATA INTO EACH TABLES
		TO VERIFY DATA TYPES
		TO VERIFY RELATIONS

		/**** PHASE 2 ****/
STEP 6:  IDENTIFY THE RELATIONS.
         DESIGN THE DIMENSIONS FOR STAR / SNOWFLAKE SCHEMA                                                                                                                      
         IMPLEMENT DIMENSION LOADS. FOR THIS, CREATE SSIS PACKAGES FOR EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL DIMENSIONS. 

STEP 7:	 CREATE SSIS PACKAGE FOR FACT TABLE
         FACT TABLE IS THE ACTUAL TABLE THAT HAS RELATIONS TO ABOVE DIMENSION TABLE.

STEP 8:	  CREATE A MASTER PACKAGE
          DEFINE CONNECTIONS TO ALL DIMENSION LOAD PACKAGES FIRST. THEN DEFINE          
	  CONNECTIONS TO FACT LOADS PACKAGE. 
          PARAMETERIZE THE CONNECTIONS. TEST THE MASTER PACKAGE.

             /**** PHASE 3 ****/
STEP 9:	 VALIDATE ALL PACKAGES
	 DEFINE SSIS LOGGING
	 DEFINE ON ERROR EVENT IN MASTER PACKAGE
	 DEFINE CHECKPOINTS WHEREVER NEDED
	 REVALIDATE THE PACKAGES

STEP 10: BUILD THE PROJECT. DEPLOY THE PROJECT FROM ISPAC FILE. TEST THECONNECTION PARAMETERS (CONFIGURE)VALIDATE PACKAGES.TEST EXECUTION.
	 SCHEDULE THE PACKAGES
